## My Biggest Mistake

**Month 1**: "I'll undercut everyone! $5/mo WordPress hosting!"

**Result**: 15 customers, $75/mo revenue, burned out from support tickets

**Month 2**: "Maybe $9/mo?"

**Result**: 30 customers, $270/mo revenue, still underwater on time investment

**Month 3**: "F*** it. $29-199/mo."

**Result**: 20 customers, $1,200/mo revenue, LESS support burden

---

## The Math That Changed Everything

### Low Pricing ($9/mo)
To hit $2,000/mo:
- Need **222 customers**
- Support tickets: ~222/month (assuming 1 per customer)
- Time investment: 50+ hours/month
- Churn matters A LOT (lose 22 customers at 10% churn = $200/mo loss)

### Premium Pricing ($29-199/mo)
To hit $2,000/mo:
- Need **25 customers** (avg $80/mo)
- Support tickets: ~15/month (better customers)
- Time investment: 8-12 hours/month
- Churn matters less (lose 2-3 customers = $200/mo loss, easier to replace)

**Same revenue. 9x fewer customers. 75% less time.**

## Why Premium Customers Are BETTER

### Low-Price Customers ($5-9/mo)
- ❌ Expect 24/7 support
- ❌ Churn at the slightest issue
- ❌ Want custom features (for free)
- ❌ Price-sensitive (will leave for $1 cheaper)
- ❌ Don't value your service

### Premium Customers ($29-199/mo)
- ✅ Understand things take time
- ✅ Stick around longer (sunk cost)
- ✅ Willing to pay for custom work
- ✅ Value-sensitive (care about quality)
- ✅ Respect your expertise

**Premium pricing is a filter for good customers.**

## Pricing Psychology Tactics I Use

### 1. Three-Tier Pricing
- Makes middle option look reasonable
- Enterprise tier increases perceived value
- "Goldilocks effect" drives Business plan sales

### 2. Annual Discount
- Monthly: $79/mo
- Annual: $790/year ($65.83/mo, save $158)
- **Result**: 40% choose annual (massive cash flow boost)

### 3. Feature Anchoring
- Don't list specs (5GB RAM, 2 CPU cores)
- List benefits (99.9% uptime, staging environments)
- Customers buy outcomes, not specs

### 4. Social Proof
- "20+ agencies trust us"
- "99.9% uptime (verified)"
- "86% profit margin (we can afford great support)"

### 5. Money-Back Guarantee
- 30-day full refund
- **Refund rate**: 2% (negligible)
- **Conversion increase**: 18%

## Objection Handling

### "That's too expensive!"
"We're definitely not the cheapest—we're focused on premium performance and support. Agencies paying $3K/mo for Kinsta move to us because we offer 80% of the quality at 25% of the price. If you're looking for budget hosting, [recommend alternative]."

**Result**: Politely filter out low-value customers.

### "Can I get a discount?"
"Our pricing is already transparent—we're showing you our 86% profit margin. We don't inflate prices to offer fake discounts. That said, we offer 17% off annual plans."

**Result**: Sets expectation of value pricing.

### "What if I need more than Enterprise?"
"We can do custom plans! Let's chat about your needs. Our custom plans start at $299/mo."

**Result**: Upsell opportunity.

## Revenue Impact

### Before Premium Pricing
- Customers: 30
- Average: $9/mo
- MRR: $270
- Support time: 40 hours/month
- Hourly rate: $6.75/hr 😱

### After Premium Pricing
- Customers: 20
- Average: $60/mo
- MRR: $1,200
- Support time: 10 hours/month
- Hourly rate: $120/hr 🎉

**Same infrastructure. Better life.**

## When to Raise Prices

### Start High
- Easier to lower than raise
- Sets quality expectations
- Filters customers early

### Grandfather Existing Customers
- Loyalty incentive
- Reduces churn
- Positive PR ("We don't screw existing customers")

### Announce Early
- Give 60 days notice
- Explain why (more features, better support)
- Offer annual lock-in at old price

---

## Industries Where This Works

✅ **Web Hosting**: Premium customers exist, they're underserved  
✅ **SaaS**: Value-based pricing standard  
✅ **APIs**: Tiered pricing well-established  
✅ **Game Servers**: Hardcore gamers pay for quality  
✅ **Discord Bots**: Large servers have budgets  

❌ **Consumer Apps**: Price sensitivity high  
❌ **Storage/Bandwidth**: Commodity, race to bottom

## The Formula

```
Premium Price = (Cost + Time × Hourly Rate + Profit) ÷ Customer Lifetime
```

**My WordPress Hosting Example**:
- Hardware cost: $3/customer/mo
- Support time: 0.5hr/customer/mo × $100/hr = $50
- Desired profit: 85% margin
- Customer lifetime: 8 months

Base price:
($3 + $50) ÷ (1 - 0.85) = $353/mo

**Reality check**: Market won't bear $353/mo from self-hoster.

**Optimization**:
- Automate support (reduce to 0.1hr) = $10
- Bundle resources (economies of scale) = $2/customer
- Premium tier subsidy from Enterprise

**Final pricing**: $29-199/mo works.

## Common Fears (And Why They're Wrong)

### Fear: "No one will pay that much"
**Reality**: The RIGHT people will. You just haven't found them yet.

### Fear: "I can't compete with big companies"
**Reality**: You compete on AGILITY and SERVICE, not price.

### Fear: "I need volume to make money"
**Reality**: 25 premium customers > 222 budget customers.

### Fear: "I'm not worth $199/mo"
**Reality**: Your customers aren't buying YOU—they're buying their time back and peace of mind.

## Action Plan

### If You're Starting
1. Research competitor pricing
2. Add 20-50% (you're offering more value)
3. Create 3 tiers
4. Start at the top end

### If You're Underpriced
1. Create new premium tier ABOVE current pricing
2. Test with new customers for 1 month
3. Announce price increase for existing (grandfather option)
4. Implement in 60 days

### If You're Stuck
1. Survey customers: "What would you pay for X feature?"
2. Run pilot premium tier
3. Validate willingness to pay
4. Adjust based on data

## The Bottom Line

**You can have 222 customers at $9/mo and hate your life.**

**Or 25 customers at $80/mo and love your business.**

Both make $2K/mo. Only one is sustainable.

**Choose premium.**
