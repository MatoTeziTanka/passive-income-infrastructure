# Version Control System - Template

This is the VERSION-CONTROL.md template I use for all my passive income services. It provides:
- Complete change history
- Progress tracking
- Issue management
- Revenue tracking
- AI collaboration support

## üéØ Real Example

Here's how I used this for my WordPress hosting service:

```markdown
### **v1.2.0** - Pricing Update & Enterprise Tier (Oct 31, 2025)
**Status**: Completed
**Objective**: Increase average revenue per customer

**Changes**:
- ‚úÖ Updated Stripe products: $9/$29 ‚Üí $29/$79/$199
- ‚úÖ Created Enterprise tier with white-label features
- ‚úÖ Updated all homepage variants with new pricing

**Revenue Impact**:
- Old pricing: Needed 68-222 customers for $2K/mo
- New pricing: Need 25-30 customers for $2K/mo
- Current MRR: $800/mo (v1.1.0) ‚Üí $1,200/mo (v1.2.0)
- Change: +$400 (+50%)

**Next Phase**: v2.0.0 - Testing & Legal Compliance
```

This single change increased my path to $2K/mo significantly by focusing on premium pricing instead of volume.
